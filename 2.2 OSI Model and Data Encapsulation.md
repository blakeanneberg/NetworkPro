Study questions:

-  What is the OSI model? Why is it important for understanding networking
	- Provides a common language and reference point for network professionals.
	-  Allows specialization of features at different levels.
	-  Aids in troubleshooting.
	-  Promotes standards of interoperability between networks and devices.
	-  Provides modularity in networking features. It allows developers to change features without changing the entire approach.
-   What are the advantages of using a theoretical model to describe networking?
	- Divides networking tasks into logical layers for easier comprehension.
-  What is the name of Layer 3 in the OSI model? Layer 5?
	- Layer 3 is Network and Layer 5 is Session
-   Which OSI model layers typically correspond to the network architecture?
	-  Layer 1 Physical and Layer 2 Data Link as they are network architecture and physical 
	- Or Transport (4 Transport and 3 Network) and Application (7 Application, 6 Presentation, 5 Session â€¦ which are HTTP and DNS)
-  Which OSI model layers typically correspond to the network protocol?  
	- 3 Network, 5 Transport, 5 Session, 6 Presentation, 7 Application.
- How does the session ID differ from the port number?
-  Which OSI model layer would you find a frame at?
	- Data Link Layer 2, Frames are data segments in Data Link Layer
-  What is the difference between connectionless and connection-oriented services?
- Limitations:
	- OSI layers are theoretical and do not perform real functions.
	- Industry implementations rarely have a layer-to-layer correspondence with the OSI layers.
	- A variety of protocols are used within the OSI model to send or receive the overall message. This can sometimes complicate the overall process.
	- A particular protocol implementation may not represent every OSI layer. A protocol may be used by multiple layers.

## 1.1.1 OSI model
### Layer 1 - Physical (Please)
- Coordinates rules for sending and receving electrical signals
- Modem devices
### Layer 2 - Data link (Do)
- Responsible for interfacing between physical transmission media (physical devices) and network layer
- Logic Link Control  LLC sub layer: interfaces between lower layers and the upper layers
 The Data Link layer controls the rate of data transmission between hosts (flow control).
 The Data Link layer controls device identification on networks, as well as how messages travel through the network (the logical topology).
- Media Access Control MAC sub layer: identifying how devices can access the physical medium. (when packet arrives from network layer, MAC address is added to packet.)
- Defines the logical topology of the network or how devices access the media
- Protocol
	- Frame: Data is called a frame where network layer packet with MAC address of the source and destination devices are added. Also in the Frame is a Cyclic Redundancy Check CRC
	- Switch devices
### Layer 3 - Network (Not)
- Moving data between systems
- Protocol
	- Routing: how each router identifies destination network and path data should take to arrive at that destination 
	- IP Address Assignments: when segment is passed off to the network layer, source and destination IP addresses are added to segment and data then becomes a packet
### Layer 4 - Transport (Throw)
- Delivers data on network, receives data from upper layers and segments it, divides data into segments and into sequence number, and identifies lost segments in transit, and controls flow between two hosts.
- The Transport layer is responsible for breaking upper-layer data into segments and allowing reliable communication through end-to-end flow control, error detection, and error correction.
- End to end flow control
- Reliable message delivery
- data segmentation and reassembly
- Protocols
	- TCP/UDP (connectionless)
	- Port Number and socket number assignment
	- Data Segment is unit of data (segmentation, sequencing and combination)
### Layer 5 - Session (Sausage)
- Helps create sessions between devices, and terminate sessions. Sets up, maintains and teardown communication sessions. 
- Manages Sessions which data is transferred. A session refers to each client connection. 
- Protocol
	- Session ID: assigns session ID number to each session to keep data streams separate. 
### Layer 6 - Presentation (Pizza)
- Formats (presents) data in a form compatible for receipt by application layer or destination system 
- Protocols
	- Syntax, formats and translates data between systems 
	- Encapsulates data into message envelopes. Encryption and SSL decryption 
	- Compression 
### Layer 7 - Application (Away)
- Connecting a application running on device and the network
- Integration of network functionality into the host operating system
- Enabling of communication between network clients and services
- Protocols: 
	- HTTP
	- FTP
	- TFTP
	- SMTP
	- Telnet
