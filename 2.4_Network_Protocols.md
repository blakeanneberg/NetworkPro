# TCP/IP
## Internet Suit Protocol vs Protocol
- Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) conceptual model and set of communication protocols. 
	- Transmission control protocol TCP is connection oriented (SYN ACK)  
	- User Data Protocol UDP is directionless 
- Protocol is a set of standards for communication between network hosts


### TCP

- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 80
- Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) [Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)] 443
- HTTPS [Transport Layer Security (TLS)] 443
- Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (over SSL) (LDAPS) 636
	- allows directory service info on all users on a network 
- File Transfer Protocol (FTP) 20/21
- Secure copy protocol (SCP)
- Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) 25
- Post Office Protocol v3 (POP3) 110
- Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) 143

#### TCP Network Specific
- Domain Name System (DNS) 53
- ightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) 389
- Telnet 23
- Secure Shell (SSH) 22



### UDP 
- Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) 69
- Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) 67/68
	- allows devices to receive config info from central server 
- Network Time Protocol (NTP) 123
####  UDP Network Specific
- Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) 161/162
- - allows alerts to monitor state of network 



- Transfer Protocol (SFTP) 22
- Server Message Block (SMB) 445
- Syslog 514
- SMTP TLS 587
	- More advanced than SSL 
- IMAP over SSL 993
- POP3 over SSL 995
- Structured Query Language (SQL) Server 1433
- SQLnet 1521
- MySQL 3306
- Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) 3389
- Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) 5060/5061
- Internet control message protocol ICMP
	- used to detect other devices, verfy network host
	- allows hosts to exchange messages to indicate a packet status as it travels though a  network
- IGMP 
	- allow a single computer to send multiple packets to multiple hosts 


- DNS 
- DHCP Server
- Directory Services: directory of user accounts on a network, also has resoureces like files and preinters as well as security settings   
- SSH
- SMB Server Message Block Samba - for linux computers and servers on windows server 
	- Samba works on individual computers to use network assetts

# Network Services
- Server
	- Window Server Manager, all services can be seen under Tools. 


# Common Network Services
- Server: runs applications
- Web services 
	- Apache Web Server
	- HTTP port 80
	- HTTP over SSL 443
	- SQL 1433
	- SQLnet 1521 (Oracle)
	- MySQL 3306 (works with OS to implemenet retaional database in a computers storage system, manage users, allow network access, enable tests on database integrity, create backups)
- SSLs and TLS 
- FTP 20/21, TFTP 69, SFTP 22, SCP
- SMTP 25, POP3 110 or 995 with SSL, IMAP4 143
- DHCP 67/68, DNS 53, NTP 123, LDAP 389, LDAPS 636
- SNMP 161/162, Telnet 23, SSH 22, Syslog 514, RDP 3389, 
- TCP, UDP and Session Initiation Protocol SIP 5060/5061 for VOIP
- Internet control message protocol ICMP 7, Internet group management protocol IGMP 2

# Network Ports 

- Well known ports range from 0 to 1023 and are assigned to common protocols and services.
- Registered ports range from 1024 to 49151 and are assigned to a specific service by ICANN.
- Dynamic (also called private or high) ports range from 49152 to 65535. They can be used by any service on an ad hoc basis. Ports are assigned when a session is established. Ports are released when the session ends.
