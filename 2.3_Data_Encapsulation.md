# Dasta Encapsulation TCP/IP Model 
1. The Application layer prepares the **data** to be sent through the network.
	- DATA
2. The Transport layer breaks the data into pieces called **segments**. The Transport layer adds sequencing and control information.
	- TCP/UDP header (Source Port and Destination Port)
3. The Internet layer converts the segments into **packets** and adds logical network and device addresses.
	- IP Header (Source IP and Destination IP)
4. The Link layer converts the packets into **frames** and adds **physical device addressing MAC** information and a **frame check sequence (FCS)** footer for error detection. It also converts the frames into bits (0s and 1s) for transmission across the transmission media.
	- Frame header (Source MAC and Destination MAC)
	- Frame Footer (FCS Checksum)

## Destination Host 
- At destination host, procesdf:wq
operates in reverse, with bits from network medium sent to the Link layer and processed up the model to destination Application layer. 

## Data Encapsulation OSI Model
* The encapsulation process works in the same manner using the OSI model. As data travels through the OSI model layers, it is broken into segments at the Transport layer. Logical addresses are added at the Network layer, making each segment a packet. The Data Link layer creates frames from each packet using the physical device (MAC) address. Frames are converted to bits at the Physical layer.
* Encapsulate goes from top to bottom
* De-Encapsulate goes from bottom to top

# Address Resolution Protocol
## ARP
- Protocol enables systems to dynamically discover MAC addresses of other systems that they are communicating with. 
* IP addresses are 4 bytes in length, each number represents 1 byte of info: 172.16.0.1 
* MAC addresses are 6 bytes in length, each pair represents 1 byte: 00-02-42-EF-IA-01
* ARP Broadcast frame: a special MAC address built into the frame, intended for all recipients: 
	- all binary 1s. 
	- each byte corresponds to 8 bits
	- 6 x 8 = 48
 * ARP unicast reply:  unicast intended directly for broadcast computer, has MAC address of replying computer and then is stored in ARP table  
- ARP Table: Allow a computer to build frames that target remote MAC addresses `arp -a`


# Packets and frames
## TCP/IP
| | TCPIP Model | | 
|-|-|-|
| | Application | |
| |  Transport | |
| Packets | Internet | Routing/IP addressing |
| Frame | Data Link | Physical (MAC Addressing) |

## Frame hop example
| Destination MAC | Source Mac | Source IP | Destination IP | Data | 
| - | - | - | - | - |
| Frame | Frame | Packet | Packet | Data |
* Packet created but multiple frames depending on how many hops as it traverses network from router to router

# Three Way Handshake and TCP flags
## Steps
1. comp 1 sends SYN packet to comp 2
2. Comp 2 receives packet and sends SYN/ACK packet to computer 1
3. Comp 1 receives SYN/AC packet and replies with ACK packet. Connection is complete

## TCP flags
| Flag | Description |
|--| --|
| SYN | Starts connection btw hosts |
| ACK | Acknowledges receipt of packet | 
| FIN | Indicates no additional info will be sent |
| RST | Resets a connection, meaning its closed |
| URG | Flags a packet as urgent | 
| PSH | Directs sending system to send buffered data |

## Scans for ports

### Open Scan
- Full connect or full open scan, completes a three way handshake on all ports
- 
### Stealth Scan
- aka a half open scan   
- Sends a SYN packet to a port.
- Three way handshake doesnt occure because orgional system doesnt reply with a final ACK

### Xmas tree scan
- gets its name because all the flags are turned on, packet is basically lit up like x mass tree.
- Recipient has no idea what to do with packet, so its either ignored or dropped
- if you get RST packet, you know the port is closed


### Idle Scan
- using a second system to perform the scan for a hacker.
