# Bandwith
- DEF: measures amount of data tha can flow from one place to another in a given amount of time
- bit DEF: abbreviation of "binary digit" and represents the smallest piece of ddate, each bit can only have one or two possible values, 0 or 1. 
- bits per second = 1 bit per second
- Kilobits per second = 1,000 bps  
- Megabits per second = 1,000,000 bps
- Gigabits per second = 1,000,000,000 bps
- Terabits per second = 1,000,000,000,000 pbs

# Throughput
- DEF: measure of transfer of bits across media over a given period of time, including delays.

- Throuput does not usually match specified bandwith
	1. Amount of data being sent and received over the connection
	2. Types of data being transmitted
	3. Latency created by the number of network devices encountered btw source and destination

# Network
- Peer to Peer
	1. Two directly connected computers where both computers are able to exchange data and services with each other. Acting as either client or a server as necessary
- End Devices
	1. Laptop
	2. Printer
