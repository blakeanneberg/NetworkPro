Data Encapsulation TCP/IP Model 
1. The Application layer prepares the **data** to be sent through the network.
2. The Transport layer breaks the data into pieces called **segments**. The Transport layer adds sequencing and control information.
3. The Internet layer converts the segments into **packets** and adds logical network and device addresses.
4. The Link layer converts the packets into **frames** and adds physical device addressing information and a frame check sequence (FCS) footer for error detection. It also converts the frames into bits (0s and 1s) for transmission across the transmission media.

## Destination Host 
- At destination host, process operates in reverse, with bits from network medium sent to the Link layer and processed up the model to destination Application layer. 

## Data Encapsulation OSI Model
* The encapsulation process works in the same manner using the OSI model. As data travels through the OSI model layers, it is broken into segments at the Transport layer. Logical addresses are added at the Network layer, making each segment a packet. The Data Link layer creates frames from each packet using the physical device (MAC) address. Frames are converted to bits at the Physical layer.
