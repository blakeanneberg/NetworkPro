# Peer to Peer
- Computers share and consume network services/resources like printers, HDD/SSDs
- Advantages:
	1. Easy to implement
	2. Inexpensive

- Cons:
	1. Not scalable 
	2. Hard to support as they don't have centralized controls. 
	3. Data storage can end up being decentralised. 
	4. Not secure as each user is in control access on computers.
	5. Not easy to backup and susceptible with malware

# Client Server Network

- Server
	1. provides network resources, like HHD/SSD and printers

- Client
	1. Doesn't provide network services but instead consumes network services

- Pros: 
	1. very scalable
	2. easy to support bc everything is centralized
	3. Data protection 

- Cons: 
	1. Expensive for servers and OS's 
	2. Advanced planning needed for which services hosting which services

# Networking Terms
- Addressing
	1. Host address
	2. Network ID, ex 192.168.1 and 10.0.0 
	3. Subnet / Network Address: DEF part of the network where all computers share the same network ID/Address but have unique host addresses. 
	4. Routers: Connect networks together.	
	5. Intranet: private network 
	6. Extranet: An intranet that is made partially available to entities outside the organization.
	7. Internetwork: two separate networks and connecting them together.
	8. Multi protocol label switching: MPLS
	9. Dynamic multipoint VPNs DMVPN: Cisco software solution for building multiple VPNs in a easy way. Use DMVPN when you need to add more sites, uses hub and spoke config. Each site uses Multipoint Generic Routing Encapsulation mGRE to tunnel a single GRE to support multiple IPsec tunnels. Spokes can also tunnel between themselves, spoke to spoke tunnels.

# Other Networks:
	1. LAN: Local area network, usually wired  
	2. WLAN: Wireless local area network, uses wireless and not wired.
	2. MAN: Metropolitan area network of many LANs
	3. WAN: Wide area network links are many MANs and LANs.
	4. PAN: Personal area network, limited range like a few feet for like Bluetooth wireless
	5. CAN: Campus area network: made up of interconnection of local area networks within a limited geographical area, 
	6. SD-WAN: software defined wide area network is a virtual WAN, that uses software to control connectivity, manage services as well as the cloud. Based on Software defined networking which separates control plane from the data plane to make networking more intelligent.
	7. ISP: connects internet to your network. Public networks share all devices and they're freely available. Private network can access public network devices, but they themselves can only be accessed b other devices within the private network

# Network Topologies
	1. Physical topology: physically wired 
	2. Logical: how network transmits data and operates 
	3. BUS: all computers connected by single central cable
	4. Ring, aka Point to Point connections: no central connecting point.
	5. Star: Uses a central connecting device with all devices connecting to central device. 
	6. Mesh networking topology: each device has a point to point connection to every other device on the network. Impractical for wired networking, but better for wireless networking. Can be used for interconnected routers, should one go down or become overloaded.
