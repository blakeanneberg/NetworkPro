# Peer to Peer
- Computers share and consume network services/resources like printers, HDD/SSDs
- Advantages:
	1. Easy to implement
	2. Inexpensive

- Cons:
	1. Not scalable 
	2. Hard to support as they don't have centralized controls. 
	3. Data storage can end up being decentralised. 
	4. Not secure as each user is in control access on computers.
	5. Not easy to backup and susceptible with malware

# Client Server Network

- Server
	1. provides network resources, like HHD/SSD and printers

- Client
	1. Doesn't provide network services but instead consumes network services

- Pros: 
	1. very scalable
	2. easy to support bc everything is centralized
	3. Data protection 

- Cons: 
	1. Expensive for servers and OS's 
	2. Advanced planning needed for which services hosting which services

# Networking Terms
- Addressing
	1. Host address
	2. Network ID, ex 192.168.1 and 10.0.0 
	3. Subnet / Network Address: DEF part of the network where all computers share the same network ID
	4. Routers: Connect networks together.	
	5. Intranet: private network 
	6. Extranet: An intranet that is made partially available to entities outside the organization.
	7. Internetwork: two separate networks and connecting them together.
	8. Multiprotocol lable switching: MPLS

# Other Networks:
	1. LAN: Local area network, ususally wired  
	2. WLAN: Wireless local area network, uses wireless and not wired.
	2. MAN: Metropolitan area network of many LANs
	3. WAN: Wide area network links are many MANs and LANs.
	4. PAN: Persnoal area network, limited range like a few feet for like bluetooth wireless
	5. CAN: Campus area network: made up of interconnection of local area networks within a limited geographical area, 
	6. SD-WAN: software defined wide area network is a virtual WAN, that uses softtware to control connectiviity, manage services as well as the cloud. Based on Software defined networking which separates control plane from the data plane to make networking more inteligent.
	
- ISP
	1. connects internet to your network
	2. Public networks share all devices and theyre freely available
	3. Private network can access public network devices, but they themselves can only be accesssed b other devices within the private network
