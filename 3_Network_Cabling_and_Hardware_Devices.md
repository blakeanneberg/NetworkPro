# Copper Cables and Connectors

1. Shielded twisted pair cabeling protects it from EMI 
2. Drain Wire  
3. Solid: conducts siganls better, prone to break 
4. Stranded: more flexiable, use for patch cables 
5. Cable categories
	- tighter twists and added shielding contribute to higher supported bandwidths 
	- Cat 5: supports 100 MB
	- Cat 5e: supports 1 GB per second
	- Cat 6: Supports up to 10 GB network for short runs
	- Cat 6a: Supports 10GB with more shielding.
	- Cat 7: Supports 10GB, shielding on each twisted pair and between, GG45 and TERA connectors.
	- Cat 8: 40 GB and 2 gigahertz. 
6. Connectors
	- Rj11: telephones, four connectors and supports up to two pairs
	- RJ45: Ethernet, eight connectors supports up to four pairs of copper wires. 
	- RJ48C: One for transmitting and one for receiving. Used for T1 WAN links. 
	- GG45: Cat 7 cabling 
	- TERA: not compatible with RJ45 or GG45
7. Coax
	- implemented in BUS network 
	- Inner conductor
	- PVC Insulator
	- Mesh shield
	- PVC sheath
	- Advantages: resist EMI
	- Disadvantage: expensive, thick and hard to install
	- Cable Grades: RG58 for Thinnet (10Base2) 50 ohms. RG-59 for cable TV 75 ohms, RG-6 satellite TV and cable modems with solid copper with 75-ohms. 
	- Connectors: BNC bayonet mount with two side lugs to lock in connection. F-type connector for cable tvs and satellite. 


## Key terms

- Crosstalk: DEF unwanted transfer of signals between communication channels
- Unshielded twisted pair UTP: DEF has grounded outer copper shield around the bungle of twisted pairs or around each pair. Provides EMI protection.
- Shielded twisted pair: DEF STP has a grounded outer copper shield around the bundle of twisted pairs or around each pair. Provides added protection against EMI
- Plenum space: DEF pathway that allows for airflow needed by heating and air con, dropped celling or raised floor
	- Plenum rated cables use insulation that is fire resistant and non toxic when burned
	- Must use plenum rated cables in plenum spaces

- Riser Space: DEF area connects multiple floors where cables can be run 
	- can use plenum rated cables in riser spaces
	- should never use riser rated cables in plenum spaces

- Wavelength division multiplexing WDM: DEF joins several light wavelengths (colors) into a single strand of fiber by using different wavelengths of laser light
