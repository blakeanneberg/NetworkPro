## ARP
- Protocol enables systems to dynamically discover MAC addresses of other systems that they are communicating with. 
* IP addresses are 4 bytes in length, each number represents 1 byte of info: 172.16.0.1 
* MAC addresses are 6 bytes in length, each pair represents 1 byte: 00-02-42-EF-IA-01
* ARP Broadcast frame: a special MAC address built into the frame, intended for all recipients: all binary 1s.   
	* each byte corresponds to 8 bits
	* 6 x 8 = 48
 * ARP unicast reply:  unicast intended directly for broadcast computer, has MAC address of replying computer and then is stored in ARP table  
- ARP Table: Allow a computer to build frames that target remote MAC addresses
